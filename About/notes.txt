Note to self: if PublisherHelper is removed, the original has probaly been updated, so get it from here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510554297
Note to self: check every so often if PublisherHelper (original) is updated, and if so, find out if that means the 1.4 port will no longer recieve updateds. If so, transistion to the original
